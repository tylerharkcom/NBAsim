# NBAsim
NBAsim is a Python program for viewing historical NBA data as well as simulating unplayed games/seasons or fantasy matchups between historical teams.

I began to develop this application to explore my interest in predictive statistical models as well as sports analytics. The suspension of the 2019-2020 NBA season due to the COVID-19 outbreak led me to pick this project back up; I could only go so long without the NBA to keep me entertained.

## Using nba_sim

After downloading the files from GitHub, navigate to the folder using the command line. Once the folder is open, use the following command to run the program:

```bash
# Mac:
python3 nba.py

# Windows:
C:\python27\python.exe nba.py
```
